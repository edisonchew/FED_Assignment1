# FED_Assignment1_SportsApparel
//In this section, I will provide an overview of my project.

In my assignment 1, I have done a revamp of a website, Rigorer. Within the pages, I have kept some of their features, such as the theme of their website color. Apart from that, I added other features and also slightly changed the page layout of the website.

# Design Process
//In this section, I will provide some insigths about my design process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how my project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

Basically, this website is for people that plays the sport of basketball as the apparels that are selling are related to it. Every company wants to attract customers to buy their things, so the project that I did to revamp the Rigorer's website could help them to attract customers.

# Features
//In this section, I will be going over the different parts of my projects, and describe each in a sentence.

 Feature 1 - At the top of my home page, I made a search bar so that people can just search whatever they want in the store.

 Feature 2 - I changed the navigation bar as I feel that the exisiting one is abit cramped up and some is redundant, as some of them all belongs to one category but it is placed separately on the navigational bar.

 Feature 3 - At the home page, I added a slideshow that the user could just click on the arrow button, it shows all the Rigorer branding items which could help to entice people to buy their stuff.

 Feature 4 - For all the pages with information about Rigorer, I have added borders and increase the font size to each of it so that it is more visible and readable.

 Feature 5 - For the footer, I have changed the layouts of it and increase the font sizes. Also, I added a Rigorers youtube(youtube icon) so that people know that Rigorer is also on that platform, which has clips of basketball games, highlights, or any branding videos.

 Feature 6 - In the footer, I have added the opening hours for the Rigorer shop so that people are aware of the store opening hours.


# Existing features

Feature 1 - The theme of the website, mostly black and white


# Features Left to Implement

Feature idea 1 - To have a chatbot within the pages itself, for example, like shopee, lazada website. So that it is easier for the user to access to the chat bot and able to help to answer to any queries.
